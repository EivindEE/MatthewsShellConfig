## What This Is
This is my current Bash and ZShell setup. It is a [mashup](http://www.wunjo.org/zsh-git/) of many things from OSS and many inventions inspired by hanging around coders [as experienced as I hope to be someday](http://nealford.com). Some pieces of these derivative scripts/ideas are such tiny fragments and are so old that I don't remember where they came from. I will gladly [give you props](mailto:matthewm@ambientideas.com) if it was you. Many others are entirely my creation.

## Contribute
In the spirit of OSS, please use this and if you customize it, [fork it](http://help.github.com/forking/) and put it back on [GitHub](http://github.com).
